# Sensor Integration Framework UML Model

The models in this directory are no longer being maintained.

The Sensor Integration Framework was originally intended to have both a UML model and an OWL Ontology. However, it proved more effective to capture the Ontology in UML. This resulted in two UML models where only one was needed. 

This work may be re-started once a need for this additional model is identified.
